This program prompts the user to enter a KNLTB (Dutch tennis assiociation) member number, and 
scrapes the web using a selenium chromedriver and finds the rating of the player at different points in time,
over this year and the past 2 years. Using the data points, we create a graph with matplotlib.
In the graph, we can see the rating progression of the player.
